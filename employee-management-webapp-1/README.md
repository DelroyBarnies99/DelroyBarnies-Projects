# Employee Managerment Web Application

Welcome! I built this employee management webapp from the ground up in spring tool suite using spring boot for my backend and html5 and css3 for the frontend.
You can register users, sign in and manage employees from a mysql database! 

- Thymeleaf as templating engine.
- Spring Data JPA and hibernate for accessing the database.
- MySQL database.
- Html5 and Css3 for the frontend.


***Spring Boot 3.0 or above***
***Html5 and CSS3***


## Installation

Place the project in your spring boot IDE and run as spring boot application. Make sure you have a MySQL database set up with the name "employee_manager" 
password "password" and username "username". I setup the database manualy in the model package of the application.
